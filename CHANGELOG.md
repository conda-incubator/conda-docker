## v0.0.2
**Added:**

* Now implements a one-layer-per-package option. There is the 125 layer limit
  in docker, so for safety we only allow 100 individiual package layers. All
  packages after the initial 100 are combined into a single, last, squashed layer.
  The packages are installed in dependency order, so base-level packages are
  more likely to get their own layer and be reused. This is inspired by
  https://grahamc.com/blog/nix-and-layered-docker-images

**Authors:**

* Anthony Scopatz
* Chris Ostrouchov


**Added:**

* Adding support for setting docker v1 layer config e.g. ENV, LABEL, CMD, ENTRYPOINT etc.

## v0.0.1
**Added:**

* Initial release of `conda-docker`!
